        Mathematics: Applications and Interpretation (HL) is an advanced two-year course for 
        quantitatively strong students who apply mathematics to model, analyze, and solve 
        real-world problems. It emphasizes data-driven reasoning, modeling with functions and 
        calculus, and technology-based exploration. Students develop skills in statistics, 
        optimization, and decision-making in authentic contexts, combining precision with 
        creativity in interpreting data. The course suits fields such as economics, business 
        analytics, data science, quantitative social sciences, and other disciplines where 
        applied mathematics informs understanding and impact.
